1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

- how to add a color from an array to the variable in css using js with style.setProperty
- how to spread text evenly within the element to fit using text-align: justify
- that lists have default margins and that removing them can help position them to our wish

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

- I wanted to make sure that the text changes together with the background change, and that the color follows the accessibility guidelines for visibility. Copilot suggested very javascript heavy approach with many functions and calculations that I believed were too much for my level. I then decided I want to make an array of objects that have the background color and a text color that fits the background and asked copilot to suggest some color pairs. However, the colors suggested mostly failed the WCAG Grading and were unreadable, so I opted out of copilot and made the color pairs by hand using contrast ratio and WCAG Grading on the whocanuse.com.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
   For this exercise I have only used the "Ask" mode on copilot, but it was also quite code heavy (as I did not ask it to not write any code). I liked the answers it gave when it was explaining the concepts and approaches, and in several occasions (like with stretching text to fit the element) using copilot was faster than to use a browser to find simple answers. For more complicated questions (like the color contrasts for background and text) I felt lost and overwhelmed using copilot, and would choose to use an approach that is longer but would help me learn more (like stackoverflow and learning webpages)

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.

- I felt too tempted to accept the code suggestions from copilot thinking that it definitely knows more than me and this would be a better solution. But I am not here for better solutions, I am here to learn.
- learning is hindered. Although learning by browsing pages can sometimes lead us to fall in a rabbit hole, on the way down we read many things that might be useful along the learning path. It has happened to me countless times, just noticing something on some stackoverflow answer that helped me solve problems days later on something unrelated.
- it can make us feel less than. I felt anxious today as I was reading the code it suggested for the color change. Should I know this already? Maybe I should be able to write it like this myself too? Will I ever be smart enough to come up with something like this myself. I think AI can be a great tool to help us understand concepts we are learning. It can summarize very well using information across several locations.
